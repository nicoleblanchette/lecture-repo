git is a way to access remote repositories?
a repository (repo) is a collection of files and their commit history, usually from a remote source
our cloud based repo storage is github
the code cmd opens up the file in vs code yippee wahoo
use an SSH key to clone and always be able to access a file without logging in
push moves local changes onto the cloud
